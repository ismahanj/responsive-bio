            Hello! my name is Ismahan. I live in seattle, Washington. My parents immigrated to Seattle when I was nine and I've lived here ever since. I work at Seattle Children's Hospital and earned my BA from U.W Tacoma. on my rare free-time, I enjoy outdoor activities with family and friends. In my portfolio I've included several google images of trails that I love to go to. I haven't been to all of them but I would like to visit them in the future. during the pandemic, I started acrylic painting and really enjoy it. I've made a few pieces to hang around the house and although it gets messy it's very relaxing. I also do henna on my free time which is an anccient form of temporary skin tatooing. I don't have pictures of my own henna art but I've included some google images of henna art. unfortunately, henna takes about an hour to dry before you can remove it so I don't do this as often as I'd like because my little ones are always on the move and my hands have to be available.
